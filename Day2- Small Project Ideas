Day2
SMALL BASIC PROJECT IDEAS THAT WILL FURTHER HELP ME WITH MY MAIN PROJECT
Industries are facing fierce competition among fellow brands, then what sets them apart is their digital presence. Here comes the part why web development industry is taking off so rapidly.
We as students also focus on our digital presence i.e Social Media Profiles. And we want to stand apart from the crowd. So what sets us apart from the crowd is our presence.
Working on projects will bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge. 

The best way to upskill in this field is to work on projects.
So I have provided here a list of small projects that will help me on my way to learning Web Development skills.

I can make the following mini projects with the help of web development tools while learning:
-One-page layout 
-Login authentication 
-Search engine result page
-Google home page lookalike
-Survey form

These are all beginner level projects. They are for giving us practical approach while learning only.

One Page Layout -
-aims to recreate a pixel perfect design and make a one-page responsive layout. 
-a beginner-level project - allows us to test our newly acquired knowledge and skill level. 

Login Authentication-
-Every website demands users to complete the login authentication for security and to improve user experience.
-beginner- level project that will honour our Javascript skills.
